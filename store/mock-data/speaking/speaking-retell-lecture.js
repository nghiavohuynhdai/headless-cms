    "expectAnswer": "Cities are interesting places. Some cities are carefully planned, built for a reason and reflects the needs of the people as it grows. Others are less conscientiously designed. Paris, for example, was originally founded in the 3rd century as a small village. And with every passing generation, it grew in size and importance. It grew from a medieval city to a modern city.   But the transition was not always smooth. Emperor Napoleon III had to hire someone to oversee the rebuilding of Paris. The man he chose was GeorgesEugène Haussmann.  In 1853, Haussmann began the process of renovating France’s capital city. His basic instruction was to bring light and air into the central districts, improve the sanitation in living areas, and make Paris a more modern, beautiful city. Haussmann’s projects included the destruction of the old, medieval neighborhoods, whitening of streets, building large parks and public squares and addition of fountains and sewer lines. To add to all of this, the size of Paris had to be increased, doubled actually. And Napoleon III issued official decrees annexing nearby suburbs to make them part of the city.  One of the main priorities of this massive renovation was to connect all the districts together. If we think of Paris as a house, each district was its own room, existing essentially independently of the other districts. Napoleon III wanted it to be easier to travel between the most important district and decreed a sense of this being one unified city, not a serious of independent neighborhoods. So Haussmann created large avenues that connected the districts.  More than that, he made all of the avenues look roughly the same. Buildings on a major avenue were required to be roughly the same height and style, and even had to use the same cream color stone for the façade. The result was to remove any local characteristics and create a uniformed Paris. For the first time, the city had a specific look. A style that people began to associate not with a district, but with Paris itself.",

    "expectAnswer": "In the Western countries, women are becoming more and more reluctant to give birth to babies. However, the male status in society remains as strong as it ever has in recent years. The birth rates increased during the earliest 20th century, but they started to decrease over these last two decades.  In the year 2000, as an example, the birth rate remained at around 1%. There are even some negative birth rates in other countries. Birth rates dropped to its lowest point that has never been seen in the society. It also has impacts on male in the society, especially young men, and it might have some connections with unemployment rates as well.",

    "expectAnswer": "Thermodynamics is the science of the flow of heat. The “thermos” is heat and “dynamics” is the motion of heat. Thermodynamics was developed largely began in the 1800s, the time of the Industrial Revolution, sustaining of steel, the beginning of generating power by burning fossil fuels. Thermodynamics dated from the same period as getting fossil fuels out of the ground. It’s universal. Turns out everything around us moves energy around in one way or the other. Your biological system, you’re burning calories, you’re creating heat. Even in astrophysics when you talk about stars, black holes, you’re moving energy around, you’re moving heat around and you’re changing matter through thermodynamics. Because thermodynamics has even been applied to economics, systems out of equilibrium like big companies can apply thermodynamic or nonequilibrium thermodynamics to economics.",

    "expectAnswer": "I believe our borders should be open. But if that is not politically acceptable for now, Europe should at least open up a legal route for people from developing countries to come work here. Over time, hopefully, we can move to a position where borders are completely open. Persuading sceptics won't be easy. That’s why I think the argument for free migration has to be made at several levels.  A principled case, it increases freedom and reduces injustice. A humanitarian case, it helps people much poorer than ourselves. An economic case, it makes us richer. And a pragmatic case, it is inevitable, so it is in everyone’s interests to make the best of it.  Freedom of movement is not just a matter of human rights and international solidarity. It is in our self-interest. Opening our borders may seem unrealistic. But so too, once did abolishing slavery or giving women the vote. Campaigning for people’s right to vote freely is a noble cause for our time.",
