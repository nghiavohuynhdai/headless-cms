    "expectAnswer": "Before we consider international environmental law and climate change, we need to consider domestic legislation, as it is within the sovereign states that international law is put into practice. This reflects the environmentalists' maxim, 'think globally act locally'. United Kingdom legislative control over the impacts of mans' activity on the environment is not new. As long ago as the reign of Charles II, the main concern was the production of smoke from the burning of 'sea coal'. Almost all areas of trade and industry were subject to very detailed legislative controls at that time, although some were governed by 'self-regulation' in the form of guilds, who regulated both supply and methods of production. However, the measures implemented were mostly ineffective because then, as now, the specifying of legal duties and standards without providing any appropriate enforcement merely indicated good intentions but were of little practical effect.  The next stage was prompted by the Industrial Revolution with the urbanisation of society and its profound effects on the environment. Local industrialists used the Adam Smith model to maximise their economic benefit, but this was to the detriment of the local environment with the operation of 'Gresham's Law' that is, the bad drives out the good. Those industrialists who were concerned for either the health of their employees or the local environment faced higher costs than their competitors. The result was the need for increasingly comprehensive statutory controls on the discharge of pollutants into various receiving media",

    "expectAnswer": "Sound receptors. You’ve got sound receptors in your ear and they are beautiful. We’re not going to talk about them at any length, but there’s little flappy, these little em … spiky things going along in your ear and they can translate vibrational energy coming from the air, hitting your eardrum, being translated into a vibration in the fluid in your ear, into a physical motion of these little receptors there, into an electrical motion, into an electrical signal that goes into your ear. So, all of that, all of that’s pretty impressive stuff. We are not going to talk about the details of it, but I invite some of you who want to learn more about this, particularly you MIT students I think find receptors really quite remarkable kinds of devices.",

    "expectAnswer": "Sea creatures are inspiring the latest devices that harness wave power. This one, called the Oyster, sits on the sea floor, and opens and closes as waves pass over it. Cables attach it to generators on the shore. Since November 2009, it’s been powering 9,000 homes in the Orkney Islands. Another device looks like a snake. The anaconda is made from a rubber tube filled with water that floats just below the surface. When the swell hits the front of it, the tube is squeezed. A bowl ripples down its length and power a turbine in its tail. Prototypes are currently being tested, but the full-scale version will be 200 meters long. This system also looks like a snake, but this one is made of steel. It floats near the surface, where waves make its joints move. This drives hydraulic system that power electrical generators. Like the anaconda, it’s still being tested. Results will prove that these devices are up to the job of supplying viable sources of green energy.",

    "expectAnswer": "I have been writing non-fiction for years actually, and… but secretly wanting to be a novelist. When I first started writing at the age of 30, it was with the intention of writing fiction, but I took a little detour for 10 or 12 years, and wrote non-fiction which I have absolutely no regret about at all. I think it was exactly the right thing for me to do, but there was that dream tucked away inside of me to do this. Now remember reading something that Eudora Welty wrote, who is, you know, the great novelist from Mississippi, who had a big influence on me actually. She said, \"no art ever came out of not risking your neck.\" And I think she's absolutely right about that. It felt that way to me at the time; it actually feels that way to me every time I sit down to write something. Finally, in the early 90s, I took my deep breath, and started writing fiction. It felt risky to me at the time to do that. And one of the very first things I wrote was, what I thought was going to be the first chapter of a novel, called \"The Secret Life of Bees\". I wrote it in 1992, and it is actually essentially the first chapter of the novel as it is now.",
