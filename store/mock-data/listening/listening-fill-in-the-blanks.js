    "description": "Simon Williams is a @Blank@ at Columbia University and the University of Western Australia. He and his colleagues trapped more than 400 mice in apartment building basements in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. They took swabs of the mice's rear ends, @Blank@ feces from the traps, and subjected both to a battery of genetic tests. The mice harbored an array of disease-causing bacteria, like shigella, Clostridium difficile, salmonella. They also carried a @Blank@ of antibiotic-resistance genes, and viruses associated with insects, dogs, chickens and pigs. @Blank@ from a Chelsea apartment building had the most pig virus—perhaps, the scientists say, because they live near the Meatpacking District, which used to have pork processing @Blank@ before @Blank@ nightclubs took over.",
