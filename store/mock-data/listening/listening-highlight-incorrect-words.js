    "description": "Darwin was of the view that music had its beginning in the sounds made by the half-human progenitors of man during the season of courtship. This seems, for many reasons, to be adequate and untenable. Theophrastus gives us a much more plausible explanation. He devotes the origin of music to the whole range of human emotions. He said that when an animal mutters a cry of joy or pain, it expresses its emotions in more or less definite tones; and at some remote period of the earth's history all primeval mankind must have expressed its emotions in much the same method. When this inarticulate speech developed into the use of certain sounds as simples for emotions - emotions that otherwise would have been expressed by the natural sounds, then we have the beginnings of speech as different from music, which is still the universal language. In other words, intelligent development begins with articulate speech. This leaves music for the expression of the emotions.",

    "description": "Everyone is interested in improving their diet. Adding grains is one of the easiest ways. Many people in the United States have a growing concern about nutrition, so grains are often seized in restaurants. And many grains are now available in grocery stores, too, though for some you still have to go to health food stores. You can stake up when you go, though, because uncooked grains keep a long time. You’ll find that grains are easy to prepare. Many grains are as simple to cook as spaghetti. Barley, for instance, is just cooked in soiled water. Remember, though, whole-grain barley, the most nutritious kind, never will get as tender as spaghetti no matter how long it’s cooked. Grain-based salads are easy, too. Just use grains left over from a hot meal. You call even put together a grain salad hours before you need it, since grains don’t whither like lettuce does. But to get back to health factors, all grains are nutritious and many have special benefits. Barley has very little fat. Some experts believe that it can even reduce cholesterol levels. Jasmine rice is also low in fat. And it has a bonus in its wonderful roams, a very special fragrance.",

    "description": "We’ve been together now in this pottery class for several weeks, and I feel you are all doing very well. I thought you might be interested in hearing about a ceramics workshop that will be held here at the college next month. Kate Ferguson, who was recently named by Ceramics Monthly as one of the decent best potters in the world, will be at the recreation centre for an intensive seven-day workshop. Participants in the workshop will, Kate has ensured me, make a lot of pots and be able to work closely with her on defining their techniques and skills. There’s only room for eighteen potters and advanced pottery students in the workshop, so everyone will get personal attention. It costs $175, which included all your materials, and a picnic, which is usually attended by all of the participants at the end of the workshop. A $50 deposit is required upfront of time, with the rest of the tuition due by May 15th. I should mention that this workshop is sponsored by the Van Howe Chemical Company, which is donating the clay. If you want to register for the workshop you should call the recreation centre at 5553080. You should really consider taking advantage of this opportunity.",

    "description": "We've already started feeling the reverse effects of global warming. Forests have been destroyed due to the rise in population of pine beetle which expanded due to the lack of severe winters. Forests are also at a high risk of catching fires. There has been a five fold increase in forest fires. The amount of carbon monoxide released due to these bog fires has resulted in fuel combustion. It's been observed that over the past couple of years, birds and butterflies have shifted their range northward by 200 kilometres in Europe and North America. Global warming has also had a devastating effect on health. The incidence of cardiovascular diseases has increased due to increased fluorocarbons in the atmosphere. Lung tissues are damaged leading to asthma. Hence, the morality rate too has been affected. This global warming has led to a higher rate of dengue and malaria cases. These insect borne diseases are on the rise and the World Health Organisation is working hard to eliminate them through vaccines.",
