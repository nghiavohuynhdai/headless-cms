    "text": "These resolutions, demanding in effect that slavery be thus safeguarded-almost to the extent of introducing it into the free states-really foreshadowed the Democratic platform of 1860 which led to the great split in that party, the victory of the Republicans under Lincoln, the subsequent secession of the more radical southern states, and finally the Civil War, for it was inevitable that the North, when once aroused, would bitterly resent such pro-slavery demands.",

    "text": "Policymakers must confront the dilemma that fossil fuels\tcontinue to be an indispensable source of energy even though burning them produces atmospheric accumulations of\tcarbon dioxide that increase the likelihood of potentially disastrous\tglobal climate change. Currently, the technology that would capture carbon dioxide emitted\tby power plants and sequester it harmlessly underground or undersea instead of releasing it\tinto\tthe atmosphere might double the cost of generating electricity.\t\nBut\tbecause\tsequestration does not affect the cost of electricity transmission and distribution, delivered prices will rise less, by no more than 50 percent. Research into better technologies for capturing carbon dioxide will undoubtedly lead to lowered costs.",

    "text": "Caffeine is a natural ingredient in coffee, cocoa, tea, and chocolate, and\tis added to some prescription and nonprescription drugs. Despite being \"natural,\" Caffeine is also a powerful drug which greatly affects the body. In healthy, rested people, a\tdose of 100 milligrams (about one cup of coffee) increases alertness, banishes drowsiness, quickens reaction time, it enhances intellectual and muscular effort, and increases heart and respiratory rates. Drinking one to two cups of coffee an hour before exercise encourages the body to preserve glycogen and burn fat – something that results in greater endurance. In addition, caffeine masks fatigue. In doses\tabove 300 milligrams, caffeine can produce sleeplessness, nervousness, irritability, headaches, heart palpitations, and muscle twitches. Caffeine is also habit-forming, and those who try to suddenly stop after heavy use may experience such withdrawal symptoms as headaches, lethargy, irritability, and difficulty in concentrating.",

    "text": "Unemployment was the overriding fact of life when Franklin D. Roosevelt became president of the United States on March 4, 1933. An anomaly of the time was that the government did not systematically collect statistics of joblessness; actually it did not start doing so until 1940. The Bureau of Labor Statistics later estimated that 12,830,000 persons were out of work in 1933, about one-fourth of a civilian labor force of more than 51 million.\nRoosevelt signed the Federal Emergency Relief Act on May 12, 1933. The president selected Harry L. Hopkins, who headed the New York relief program, to run FERA. A gifted administrator, Hopkins quickly put the program into high gear. He gathered a small staff in Washington and brought the state relief organizations into the FERA system.\nWhile the agency tried to provide all the necessities, food came first. City dwellers usually got an allowance for fuel, and rent for one month was provided in case of eviction.",
